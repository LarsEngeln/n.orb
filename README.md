# n.orb
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LarsEngeln/n.orb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LarsEngeln/n.orb)

n.orb is a little mini game where you are a orb on a orb... sounds funny, but it is probably not.

Is it "playable" right now? - No :c
But there will be a co-orb-mode :D!

### setting things up
It is assumed that you have already installed node and yarn.

So, open a console and install dependencies with:
```sh
> yarn
```
and kick of webpack's building with:
```sh
> yarn build
```
For quick dip you can spawn a dev-server with:
```sh
> yarn start
```
and open _http://localhost:8080/www/_.
