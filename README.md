n.orb is a little mini game where you are a orb on a orb... sounds funny, but it is probably not.

Is it "playable" right now? - No :c , but there will be a co-orb-mode :D!

### setting things up
It is assumed that you have already installed node and yarn.

So, open a console and install dependencies with:
```sh
> yarn
```
and kick of webpack's building with:
```sh
> yarn build
```
For quick dip you can spawn a dev-server with:
```sh
> yarn start
```
and open _http://localhost:8080/www/_.

### lore
This is n.orb.ert (good friends call him n.orb) and this is chief-orb.erator t.orb.en (good friends call him t.orb).
The z.orb's are your main orb.ponents, who try to abs.orb our beloved s.orb.et.
The f.orbs-magazin reported that the f.orb.iddingly evil z.orb's have been entered the orb.it. 

The p.orb.e is blessing the whole orb with Orbi et Orbi.
That's orb.icular orby!
